Data Science Capstone, Project 3 | Mark Hassan

**Project Overview**

The customers of Acme Communications (who own a popular messaging platform), are consistently sharing feedback that the platform is overwhelming and hard to keep up with for long threads. 

Acme’s product team has identified automated conversation summarization as a solution to this user experience challenge. 

The goal of this work is to create a prototype conversation summarzation tool using a pre-trained BERT model. This prototype should:

1. Provide accurate and succinct summaries of long conversations/threads
2. Allow a user to stay current with more conversations 
3. Demonstrate the value that AI powered features can bring to the product.

The data source for this project is the SAMsum dataset, which is a synthetic dataset with about 16,000 instant message style conversations with accompanying summaries.
